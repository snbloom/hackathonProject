Make School Summer Academy 2018 Hackathon Group Project

We had one week to create and ship an app. Our idea is to create an app that allows the iOS user to send physical mail without having to go to the Post Office or buy stamps. They are able to write a letter on their iOS device and send the letter on the app directly!

Hope you enjoy our app!
